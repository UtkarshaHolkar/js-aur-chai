--------------ASYNCHRONUS JAVASCRIPT---------------
 
// default behaviour of JS

 * Javascript is a synchronus language
 (line by line code is run ) by default

 * Javascript is a Single threaded language
 (ek hi thread pr sb kuch execute hoga)

//  execution context---------------->>>
execute one line of code at a time
 
(each operation waits for the last one for complete v=before executing)

// BLOCKING CODE & NON BLOCKING CODE -------

 BLOCKING CODE --> block the flow of program 

 non BLOCKING CODE -->does not block the flow of program (execution)

// this is about the async js // remove this line just for commit
